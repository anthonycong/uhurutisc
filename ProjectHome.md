We combine in a single computer program: 1) a thin-sheet viscous model of continental deformation; 2) a stream-power surface transport approach; 3) flexural isostasy allowing for the formation of large sedimentary foreland basins; and 4) an orographic precipitation model that reproduces basic climatic effects such as continentality and rain shadow.
